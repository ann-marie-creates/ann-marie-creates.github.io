MPD's or Myeloproliferative disorders are a spectrum of serious blood disorders that affect young and old alike. In the early 2000s, people who were newly diagnosed were frustrated that they could not find information online to help them understand and navigate their illness. 

I joined forces with a chief consultant from Guy’s and St Thomas’ Trust in London to rebrand and create a website for MPDSupport. Funding was very limited, so I worked with a talented creative agency able to work on lean budget. 

We used meaningful content that was readily at hand: the stories of individual patients. We developed a highly interactive, informative and empathetic platform for a wide range of sufferers, The photographer donated his services at no charge, creating the exquisite and emotionally compelling images of sufferers. 

**Through this work we created a strong brand with unique positioning. This attracted the interest of major donors who funded research into these disorders. Most importantly, the new brand and content gave MPD sufferers and their carers a voice.**

**Recommendations**

_Recommendation from hematologist Ruben Mesa, M.D.: In working with Ann Marie I found her to be engaged, highly committed and to have clear long-term vision. She is highly perceptive of people's needs and adept at translating complex concepts into accessible, meaningful and empowering language. She and the team at MPD Voice executed a multi-year plan to build an exceedingly professional online presence which has become the go-to destination for information about these rare disorders. I found Ann Marie to be personable, caring and a pleasure to work with. In my 20 year experience in healthcare, and communications, she is amongst the top 5 individuals I have worked with in her effectiveness."_

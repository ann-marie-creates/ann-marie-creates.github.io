# Giving people with rare blood cancers a voice

Organization: MPDVoice

Location: London, England

MPD's or Myeloproliferative disorders are a spectrum of serious blood disorders that affect young and old alike. In the early 2000s, people who were newly diagnosed were frustrated that they could not find information online to help them understand and navigate their illness. 

I joined forces with a chief consultant from Guy’s and St Thomas’ Trust in London to rebrand and create a website for MPDSupport. Funding was very limited, so I worked with a talented creative agency to use meaningful content that was readily at hand: the stories of individual patients. We developed a highly interactive, informative and empathetic platform for a wide range of sufferers, The photographer donated his services at no charge, creating the exquisite and emotionally compelling images of sufferers. 

**Through this work we created a strong brand that attracted major donors -- and most importantly gave MPD sufferers and their carers a voice.**

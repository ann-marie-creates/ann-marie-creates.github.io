# Humanizing technology with empathy 

Organization: Mayo Clinic

Location: Rochester, Minnesota

Mayo Clinic saw an opportunity in 2015 to develop a unique consumer genetic testing product: one that empowered people by putting genetic test results back in the context of their overall health and wellness. Mayo Clinic GeneGuide leveraged Mayo's expertise in not just genetics, but in areas of medical care across the organization. 

The product included test results in four areas of genetics: carrier screening, response to medications (pharmacogenomics), health traits and risk for complex illnesses such as coronary artery disease.

As the product management leader on this project, I encountered unique challenges of building a complex and expansive consumer health product that wove Mayo Clinic's medical expertise into experience that would engage consumers, one a lean budget. The Mayo Clinic physicians and genetic experts working on the project placed strong emphasis on conveying honest medical information that would place genetic health risks in the context of lifestyle and other risks.

We met this challenge by creating proprietary tools based on how physicians explain health risks to patients in the clinical setting. These engaging tools help people to visualize the different kinds of health risks that contributes to their overall risk of disease. 

In the words of the design agency who worked on this project:

_"Where do you start when you need to communicate something incredibly difficult and technically complex? You start by putting yourself in the other person’s shoes. Customers didn’t just need educating about the facts of the matter - gaining their trust was just as vital a part of the journey._

_That’s why we developed lifestyle and ancestry tools that patients could access in the six-week wait between sending off their saliva test and seeing the result. The result was a client with highly engaged and educated customers. A clear narrative won the day, as it always does."_

Mayo Clinic GeneGuide was build in partnership between a traditional health care organization with a 150 year history and a California startup, with dozens of stakeholders, complex regulatory and privacy requirements, a remote development team (in Montreal) and a remote design team (in London). It was also the first cloud-based product ever created at Mayo Clinic. 

**I'm very proud to have been a leader on this team and to have brought this meaningful, consumer-friendly health product to market in 2018 for one of the greatest brands in healthcare.**

**Recommendations**

_Recommendation from David Weiss, Mayo Clinic GeneGuide marketing manager: "There are not many who could undertake such a challenge, but Anne Marie, as the Senior Product Manager, proved to have the perfect mix of skills, tenacity and temperament that was necessary to ensure success. The coordination of myriad internal and external stakeholders alone was a huge undertaking, not to mention the diverse personalities, egos, and differing opinions that also needed to be managed. Serving in the role as Senior Project Manager also required a broad knowledge of every aspect of the project, including technical, research, legal, regulatory, marketing/communications, project management, negotiation and, an uncanny ability to drive consensus and product direction. Ann Marie has proven to be an effective and capable leader who encourages open dialogue, opinions and new ideas. In doing so, she has earned my respect and admiration and that of many of her colleagues, peers and superiors."_

**ABOUT BARBERINI SPA**

An Italian manufacturing company, Barberini produces superb quality optical glass lenses for the most prestigious eyewear brands across the world. Their lenses feature innovative technologies, such as polarization, super-lightweight lenses and thin film coatings that enhance vision.

**MY WORK**

Barberini SpA produces exclusively glass sunglass lenses. They were concerned about their market share at a time when plastic lenses were becoming ubiquitous in the sunglass industry. I consulted with the company’s founder, Pietro Barberini, and advised him to focus less on competitors and more on the intrinsic value of their unique product and brand. I believed that the company could grow while staying true to the company's heritage. 

**RESULTS**

I recommended that Barberini pursue polarized glass lens development. The dynamic leadership invested in cutting edge robotic technology to perfect this product and produce it at scale. This strategy immediately proved extremely successful and created long-term value for the organization.

I was later recruited to join the company as Director of Sales & Marketing, where I grew Barberini’s revenue with brands such as Ray-Ban, and worked hand-in-hand with creators at Fossil, Coach and Gucci to develop unique eyewear lenses for those brands. My knowledge of decision making at matrixed U.S. companies such as Bausch & Lomb, together with my language skills in English (native), Italian and French, allowed me to assist Barberini in negotiating a lucrative contract with Bausch & Lomb for polarized lenses under the Ray-Ban brand.

The world’s largest eyewear group, Luxottica, acquired Barberini in 2018 in a $163 million deal.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

_Recommendation from Lorenzo Barberini, previous owner of Barberini SpA: "Ann Marie and I worked together for many years when I was the owner of an optical company in Italy. I first came to know Ann Marie when she was a customer of my company's, and we later recruited her to join us as Director of Marketing. She is an extremely accomplished and insightful professional, who offered us ideas and suggested strategies for expanding our business, and helped us to take advantage of opportunities in the US market. She encouraged us to develop a new product line, polarized lenses, that became one of our top-selling lines - in fact our bread-and-butter. She speaks fluent Italian and French and she understands the European market like a native. I highly recommend Ann Marie for any strategic role."_

**ABOUT PALM**

Palm Computing was the pioneer in handheld computing. The company was founded in 1992 by the visionary Jeff Hawkins, who together with Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan developed the first successful "personal digital assistant" or PDA: the Palm Pilot.

As a company, Palm had a unique and customer-obsessed outlook. To quote from _The Zen of Palm_: "Avoid the siren call of 'features for features’ sake.' It will lead you down the path of suffering and small market share. Instead, focus on the user’s experience with your product. Convenience and usability are power. Most importantly, focus on the inner tranquility of the customer."

**MY WORK**

I joined Palm Computing as the company, at that time with $2 billion in revenue, was transitioning from its hugely successful Palm V PDA to newer, more advanced products. I took on responsibility for the accessories and later the peripherals P&Ls, totaling approximately $50 million in revenue.

As the company transitioned to new products, I assisted the leaders that had built this high revenue line with organizing for a more mature business. I put a data-driven forecasting process in place, decreased the high inventory levels, pruned down a very large number of SKUs, and improved contribution margins from 45% to 65%. Working hand-in-hand with colleagues in Sales, Supply Chain and Finance, I succeeded in creating a lean, highly profitable and manageable collection that continued to grow in revenue.

This new lean lineup allowed us to re-focus on creation of fresh, innovative and best-selling new products, including a Tungsten T aluminum hard case that was patented and selected by Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design for their Good Design award and permanent collection (2002). Credit goes to industrial designer Marc Van de Loo of Patria Design.

The result of these efforts was a lean product line that provided higher margins, sold through better at the retail level, reduced inventory risk and most of all matched Palm's brand values for innovation.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

_Recommendation from Rajesh Kalidindi, former Palm colleague, now CEO of LevaData: "Ann Marie is a talented, high-energy, results-oriented and productive product management expert. I worked with Ann Marie at Palm, where she and I combined forces to transform a weakly profitable, overstocked accessories line-up into a high-margin, fresh, saleble and fast-turning collection. It was a pleasure to work with Ann Marie - she would be valuable asset to any team."_

_Recommendation from Lawrence Lam, former Palm colleague now with Google: I've worked with Ann Marie multiple times at several companies. In all instances, she provides clear direction to all project disciplines and orchestrates everyone in unison to hit agressive targets while still maintaining quality and upholding solid brand values. Her background intermingles a worldy knowledge of fashion, technology, product development and humanities. Her management style encourages the experts to rise to the occasion, and brings joy to those that have passion for their craft. I highly recommend Ann Marie in any endeavour that she pursues."_

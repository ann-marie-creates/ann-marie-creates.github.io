**ABOUT THE MAYO CLINIC MOBILE APP**

The Mayo Clinic mobile app was created for Mayo Clinic patients, to give them ultra-convenient access to all their healthcare data: their appointment schedule, test results, messages to their care team and more. The app has been rated by Apple as the #1 wellness mobile app in the AppStore. The app is offered on both iOS and Android platforms.

**MY WORK ON THE MAYO CLINIC APP**

In 2012 I joined a cross-functional team of talented, passionate and dynamic Mayo Clinic developers and user experience designers working on the Mayo Clinic mobile app. Our objective: to advance from a Minimum Viable Product to the next level of simple and sophisticated usability and value for people using the app.

I focused the team on leading with superb easy of use and functionality. I encouraged the team to let the brand value come through by putting the needs of the patients first, with seamless, intuitive navigation and useful features for managing each person’s health and wellness, including Apple HealthKit integration.

With support from Apple’s user experience evangelists, Mayo’s talented design team developed iconography and a color system that resulted in increased findability and intuitive navigation. 

**RESULTS**

The result was a highly usable product, beloved by Mayo Clinic patients, rated by Apple as the #1 wellness app.

**USER FEEDBACK**

_“Utilitarian Excellence: By far the easiest and most functional healthcare app available. Messaging, records, labs, imaging, allergies, immunizations, medications, vitals...a great deal of distance ahead of any I have used.”_

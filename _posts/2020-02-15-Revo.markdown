The Revo brand broke new ground in the sunglass industry when it lauched the "super premium" sunglass category with the now iconic ad campaign featuring astronaut Pete Conrad, the third man on the moon. Revo used coatings designed to protect NASA satellites on their lenses to protect the wearers' eyes. The beautiful and functional irridescent blue coating became synonymous with the Revo brand.

**Efforts I led at Revo:**

+ _Source the world's highest quality frames and lenses_ from small factories in Italy, France and Japan. My French and Italian language skills allowed me to make connections and discover small artisans. Manufacturing products to Revo's stringent quality specifications became possible with the right suppliers and sleeves-rolled-up discussions with the manufacturing teams. 

+ _Create a culture of quality_ working hand-in-hand with Operations leadership and our wonderful assembly team in California. One very successful effort involved repurposing machines for opticians to set up statistical process control. This work uncovered and allowed us to resolve product quality problems. This saved the company at least $5M and strengthened relationships with our suppliers, as we worked together to overcome manufacturing problems.

+ _Strengthen design and reduce time to market_ by engaging several highly talented designers and colorists (all formerly Apple employees) to design sunglasses that were more unique and wearable with a higher coolness factor, both for sports and fashion. Our Sales team needed a faster turn-around time on new styles to hit the market in time for holidays. Again working with Operations leadership, we reduced time to design and produce new products, resulting in faster turns and higher revenue.

**While working at Revo, I learned from the wonderful leaders who built the company how to launch a new brand successfully and create products that people love. I am truly grateful to the founders, the artisans we worked with and my colleagues for this amazing voyage.**

**Recommendations**

_Recommendation from Jim Pritts, Vice President at Revo and now an independent consultant: "Ann Marie's combination of tireless work ethic, strong communication abilities (written and verbal, including multiple languages), organization skills, and attention to details provided the ideal characteristics needed to design and develop the super-premium eyewear which helped make Revo the market leader in super-premium sunwear. She was widely appreciated and respected by suppliers, customers, and company colleagues."_

**ABOUT REVO**

The Revo brand broke new ground in the sunglass industry when it lauched the "super premium" sunglass category. The brand burst onto the scene with its now iconic ad campaign featuring astronaut Pete Conrad, the third man on the moon. Revo used multi-layer thin film coatings on its sunglass lenses -- the same coatings designed to protect NASA satellites in space. The beautiful and functional irridescent blue coating became synonymous with the Revo brand.

**MY WORK AT REVO**

+ _Sourced the world's highest quality frames and lenses_ from small factories in Italy, France and Japan. My French and Italian language skills allowed me to make connections and discover small artisans. Manufacturing products to Revo's stringent quality specifications became possible with the right suppliers and sleeves-rolled-up discussions with the manufacturing teams. 

+ _Created a culture of quality,_  working hand-in-hand with operations leadership and our wonderful assembly team in California. I was very successful in discovering the root causes of quality problems. I was inspired by courses I took at the Numi Toyota plan in Fremont, California (now the Tesla plant) to introduce statistical process control. Lacking a budget, I repurposed machines that opticians use to cut eyeglass lenses to do our measuring. This work uncovered surprising sources of quality issues and gave us the knowledge to solve them. This program saved the company over $5M. I insisted upon blame-free discussions, which strengthened relationships with our suppliers, as we worked together to overcome manufacturing problems.

+ _Strengthened design and reduced time to market_ by engaging several highly talented designers and colorists (all formerly Apple employees) to design sunglasses that were more unique and very wearable, with a higher coolness factor. Our sales team needed a faster turn-around time on new styles to hit the market in time for holidays. Again working with operations leadership, we reduced time to design and produce new products, resulting in faster turns and higher revenue.

I have remained deeply grateful throughout my career to the immensely creative and consumer-obsessed leaders who built the Revo company. At an early stage in my career, they showed me how to create products that people love, and taught me the meticulous attention to detail that takes customer experiences from good to extraordinary. I have the greatest respect for the founders, the artisans we worked with in Italy, France and Japan, and for my trusted colleagues who shared this amazing voyage.

_Recommendation from Jim Pritts, Vice President at Revo and now an independent consultant: "Ann Marie's combination of tireless work ethic, strong communication abilities (written and verbal, including multiple languages), organization skills, and attention to details provided the ideal characteristics needed to design and develop the super-premium eyewear which helped make Revo the market leader in super-premium sunwear. She was widely appreciated and respected by suppliers, customers, and company colleagues."_

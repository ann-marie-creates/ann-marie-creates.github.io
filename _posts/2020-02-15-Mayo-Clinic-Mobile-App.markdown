In 2012 I joined a cross-functional team of talented,passionate and dynamic Mayo Clinic developers and user experience designers working on the Mayo Clinic mobile app. Our objective: to take the Mayo Clinic app from Minimum Viable Product to the next level of usability and value for people using the app.

I focused the team on leading with superb easy of use and functionality. I encouraged the team to let the brand come through by putting the needs of the patients first, through seamless, intuitive navigation and useful, sophisticated features for managing each person’s health and wellness, including Apple HealthKit integration.

With support from Apple’s user experience evangelists, Mayo’s talented design team developed iconography and a color system that resulting in increased findability and intuitive navigation. 

The result was a highly usable product, beloved by Mayo Clinic patients, rated by Apple as the #1 wellness app.

**User Feedback**

_“Utilitarian Excellence: By far the easiest and most functional healthcare app available. Messaging, records, labs, imaging, allergies, immunizations, medications, vitals...a great deal of distance ahead of any I have used.”_

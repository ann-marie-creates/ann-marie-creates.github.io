I joined Palm Computing (the original handheld computers) at the time Palm was transitioning from its hugely successful Palm V personal digital assistant (PDA) to new, more advanced products. I took on responsibility for the accessories and later peripherals P&Ls.

Palm's leadership considered outsourcing the entire product line. As this was under consideration, I took on the challenge of taking a very large number of SKUs with limited profitability, and refining the product line to be lean, highly profitable and manageable. Working together with Sales, Finance, Supply Chain and Industrial Design, we:

+ _Instituted a forecasting process_ to track sales trends and react to market needs, whether accelerating or declining.

+ _Increased contribution margins_ from 45% to 65% to ensure profitability.

+ _Designed innovative and best-selling new products_ including a Tungsten T aluminum hard case that was patented product and selected by Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design for their Good Design award and permanent collection (2002). Credit goes to Marc Van de Loo of Patria Design.

**The result of these efforts was a lean product line that provided higher margins, sold through better at the retail level, reduced inventory risk and most of all matched Palm's brand values for innovation.**

**Recommendations**

_Recommendation from Rajesh Kalidindi, former Palm colleague, now CEO of LevaData: "Ann Marie is a talented, high-energy, results-oriented and productive product management expert. I worked with Ann Marie at Palm, where she and I combined forces to transform a weakly profitable, overstocked accessories line-up into a high-margin, fresh, saleble and fast-turning collection. It was a pleasure to work with Ann Marie - she would be valuable asset to any team."_

_Recommendation from Lawrence Lam, former Palm colleague now with Google: I've worked with Ann Marie multiple times at several companies. In all instances, she provides clear direction to all project disciplines and orchestrates everyone in unison to hit agressive targets while still maintaining quality and upholding solid brand values. Her background intermingles a worldy knowledge of fashion, technology, product development and humanities. Her management style encourages the experts to rise to the occasion, and brings joy to those that have passion for their craft. I highly recommend Ann Marie in any endeavour that she pursues."_

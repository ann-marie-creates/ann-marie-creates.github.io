# Humanizing technology with empathy 

Organization: Mayo Clinic

Location: Rochester, Minnesota

**ABOUT MAYO CLINIC GENEGUIDE(R)**

Mayo Clinic is rated by _U.S. News & World Report_ as the #1 healthcare organization in the United States. 

With its esteemed brand and deep medical and research expertise, Mayo Clinic saw an opportunity in 2015 to enter the consumer products space with a genetic testing product. The goal: to empower people with information about their genetics, while placing genetic risks in the context of overall health risks. Partnering with a startup called Helix allowed Mayo to offer this unique product at an affordable consumer price. 

The product included test results in four areas of genetics: carrier screening, response to medications (pharmacogenomics), health traits and risk for complex illnesses such as coronary artery disease.

**UNIQUE PRODUCT CHALLENGES**

As the product management leader on this project, my team and I encountered unique challenges: building a complex and expansive consumer health product, weaving in Mayo Clinic's medical expertise, and engaging consumers with a great customer experience, all with a small team and on a lean budget. I met this challenges through great persistence by balancing the perspectives of numerous stakeholders. 

**LASER FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE**

The customer experience, navigation and content in consumer genetics products require thoughtful and delicate handling. My goal throughout was to create a very simple user journey, supporting the customer along the way with clear explanations, and especially avoiding confusion. Purchasers of consumer genetics product can feel stressed and afraid as they learn about their health risks. I took care to give our users absolute clarity and to create an empathetic voyage that would alleviate stress. 

I accomplished this by engaging a talented design team, developing a clear "blueprint" for the product experience, and especially talking with consumers and testing the experience at every stage, all while staying a few weeks ahead of development!

**A LARGE SCALE EFFORT ACROSS LOCATIONS**

Mayo Clinic GeneGuide development was an international project, with 4 Agile teams based in Montreal, a design firm in London, stakeholders at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and partners in both California and New York. The product was also the very first cloud project at Mayo Clinic. 

**RESULTS**

I'm very proud to have been a leader on this team and to have brought this meaningful, consumer-friendly health product to market in 2018 for one of the greatest brands in healthcare. The Mayo Clinic GeneGuide product has created a new source of revenue for the clinic. 

**PERSPECTIVE FROM THE DESIGNERS**

In the words of the design agency who worked on this project:

_"Where do you start when you need to communicate something incredibly difficult and technically complex? You start by putting yourself in the other person’s shoes. Customers didn’t just need educating about the facts of the matter - gaining their trust was just as vital a part of the journey._

_That’s why we developed lifestyle and ancestry tools that patients could access in the six-week wait between sending off their saliva test and seeing the result. The result was a client with highly engaged and educated customers. A clear narrative won the day, as it always does."_

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

_Recommendation from David Weiss, Mayo Clinic GeneGuide marketing manager: "There are not many who could undertake such a challenge, but Ann Marie, as the Senior Product Manager, proved to have the perfect mix of skills, tenacity and temperament that was necessary to ensure success. The coordination of myriad internal and external stakeholders alone was a huge undertaking, not to mention the diverse personalities, egos, and differing opinions that also needed to be managed. Serving in the role as Senior Product Manager also required a broad knowledge of every aspect of the project, including technical, research, legal, regulatory, marketing/communications, project management, negotiation and, an uncanny ability to drive consensus and product direction. Ann Marie has proven to be an effective and capable leader who encourages open dialogue, opinions and new ideas. In doing so, she has earned my respect and admiration and that of many of her colleagues, peers and superiors."_
